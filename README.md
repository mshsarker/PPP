As name suggests, its a plaground. Particularly it doesnt have any strict rules if any rules at all.

<<<<Disclaimer>>>> This is very important to say that solutions and questions might be original, inspired and some cases as it is found by the author around the internet and numerous books. My special thanks go to "Colt Steele" and his outstanding course "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Initially, most of the content of this playground came from this great mind.
